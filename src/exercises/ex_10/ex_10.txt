Given the following list:

*py* 
[7, 1, 3, 10, 4, 19, 2, 3, 4] 
*py* 

Write a program that:
1. Finds the smallest value in the list
2. If the number found at point 1 is even, print it. Otherwise, return a string containing an error message.
 
Note: Try solving the exercise without using the min() method
