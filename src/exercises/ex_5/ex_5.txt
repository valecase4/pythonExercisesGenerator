Given the list of tuples:

*py*[(9, 3), (4, 5), (9, 9), (4, 2), (10, 2), (20, 3), (4, 1)] 


Each tuple contains two numbers. You need to find the tuples where both numbers are even. Then, among all such tuples you 
must print the one where the sum of the two numbers is the largest.

* SOLUTION * = (10, 2)
