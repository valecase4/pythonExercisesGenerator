Given the dictionary: 


*py*{
*py**tab*"triangle_1": [(0, 0), (2, 5), (5, 4)],
*py**tab*"triangle_2": [(4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6)],
*py**tab*"triangle_3": [(10, 1), (6, 3), (5, 0)]
*py*} 


Each key is a triangle and the corresponding value is a list of three tuples, where each tuple is one of the three points
for that triangle (represented in coordinates).

Create a dictionary in which each triangle is associated with its perimeter
